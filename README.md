1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The client was The Gaming Room and their software requirements was for their game Draw It or Lose It, it was created for Android systems and they wanted to make it cross-platform.
  
2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  
  I was able to use the guidelines to go through and add the functions that were requested
  
3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  
  I believe that while working through the design document, it gave me more insite about what was needed in the code.
  
4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  
  I would have to say that the one thing that I have improved on would be the amount of detail that I have. I think that I should have had more detail in my documents.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  
  I would have to say that the reason that it is important to consider the user's needs when designing is that you are designing the software for the client and for them to be able to give the user a great experience so that they will keep coming back.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  
  One of the things that I did was look at the files and look for errors within those files. after fixing any error that I may have seen then I would run the software to ensure that it would run as expected. by doing this it gave me the knowledge that I will need in the future to be able to work out any bugs that may come up.
